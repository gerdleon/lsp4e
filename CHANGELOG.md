* [CommandExecutor](org.eclipse.lsp4e/src/org/eclipse/lsp4e/command/CommandExecutor.java) has been updated with the improvements that were originally developed in WildWebDeveloper. Migrating those changes back to LSP4E makes these improvements available for all consumers of LSP4E.

See also the [Bugzilla issues](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/buglist.cgi?product=lsp4e&target_milestone=0.17.0) for details of bug fixes and other items changed in this release.

Breaking Changes:

* Eclipse LSP4J has some breaking API changes. While LSP4E's directly declared API did not change,
  places where LSP4J types are exposed to LSP4E's client code there may be some API change effects.
  Please consult [LSP4J v0.10.0](https://github.com/eclipse/lsp4j/releases/tag/v0.10.0) for more
  details.
